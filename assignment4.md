Reflection on statistics.
We have seen 4 measurements of central tendency (the *average*): mean, median, mode and midpoint.

Do you think one of them is a better measure of central tendency (finding an *average*) than the others?  There are several resources to help you answer this question that can be accessed with a google search on the Internet.

Your assignment is to 
1. Find an article appropriate to your level of understanding that helps you decide if one method is better than the others
2. Think about and describe situations where one measure would be more appropriate/useful than another.
3. Write a paragraph here that discusses your answer.


There are several ways to describe central tendency of a set of numbers and each one is useful in different situations. The mean considers all data points, which makes it very accurate when the numbers are consistent. However, it can be misleading when there are extreme values, because even one unusually high or low number can pull the mean away from what most of the data shows. In those cases, the median is often a better choice since it focuses on the middle of the data without being affected by extremes. The mode is useful when we care about what happens most often, such as finding the most common shoe size or customer preference, but it does not always reflect the general trend. The midpoint, which is halfway between the smallest and largest numbers, can provide a quick idea of the range, but it does not always represent the data accurately. Overall, I think the median gives the most reliable picture in real-world situations, where data is uneven, while the mean work best for balanced data sets. The "best" measure really depends on the situation and what we are trying to understand about the data.
